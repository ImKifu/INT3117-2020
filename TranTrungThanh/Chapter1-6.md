>If you have never worked for a software development company, what level of test maturity do you think that you have? (0: testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness, 2: testing shows the program doesn’t work, 3: testing reduces risk, 4: testing is a mental discipline about quality).

(b)
Em đánh giá level testing nằm ở mức 1: kiểm tra thể hiện tính đúng đắn.
