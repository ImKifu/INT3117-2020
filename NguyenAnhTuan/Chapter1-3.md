# 3. What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?
- Testing can show the presence of failures but not their absence.
- Using the software, we are always at risk. The risk could be insignificant or could be significant.
- We can't reduce the risk to zero.
