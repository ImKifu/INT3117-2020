# 6. Answer question (a) or (b), but not both, depending on your background.
(b) If you have never worked for a software development company, what level of test maturity do you think that you have? (0: testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness, 2: testing shows the program doesnâ€™t work, 3: testing reduces risk, 4: testing is a mental discipline about quality).
- I think i have level 0(testing = debugging) of test maturity since i do not have any experience in software testing.
