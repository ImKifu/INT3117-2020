1.	Why do testers automate tests? What are the limitations of automation?
-	Automation can help in many areas, most often to relieve the tester from repetitive, mechanical tasks. Checking of testing criteria can be automated through instrumentation, which allows a higher level of testing to be performed. Automation will always run into undecidable problems, such as infeasible paths, test case generation, internal variables, etc. Automation cannot help validate output or make creative decisions.
