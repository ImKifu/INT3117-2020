1.	How are faults and failures related to testing and debugging?

-	Faults are problems in the code, failures are incorrect external events. Depending on which of Beizer's levels you are working in, testing is the process of trying to cause failures or to show that they occur at an acceptable rate. In contrast, debugging is a diagnostic process where, given a failure, an attempt is made to find the associated fault.
